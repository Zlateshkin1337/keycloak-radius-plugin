Hello Elkman! I haven't found any other way to contact you other than a text file in the repository. I was faced with one task of changing the password in keycloak via email and realized that it was impossible to change the radius password in this way. There is no such step in flow keycloak. I see that you update and support this plugin. Is it possible to add such functionality? Please write to me if possible at traneboy@mail.ru or telegram @zlateshkin. Thank you in advance!
